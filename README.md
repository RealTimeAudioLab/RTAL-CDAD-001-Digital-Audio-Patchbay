# About this Repository

Every engineering project begins with a problem.

During the mid-1990s digital audio equipment rapidly increased in complexity.

The RTAL Digital Audio Patchbay was developed to become the central switching system of an entire digital recording studio.

This repository preserves the complete engineering archive of the **Digital Audio Patchbay**, a professional digital audio routing system developed during 1995.

Unlike most open-source repositories, this project documents not only the software but the complete engineering process, including original hardware, firmware, programmable logic, historical design documents and prototype photographs.

The objective is to preserve this engineering work for future developers, students and audio enthusiasts.

# Why was this project developed?

During the 1990s, digital audio systems became increasingly complex.

CD players, DAT recorders, MiniDisc systems, computers and digital musical instruments all provided optical and coaxial S/PDIF interfaces.

However, there was no central device that combined flexible digital routing, DSP integration, sample rate conversion and S/PDIF bitstream manipulation.

The Digital Audio Patchbay was therefore developed as a complete engineering solution for an entire digital music system.

Its objectives included:

* Central routing of all digital audio connections
* Support for optical and coaxial S/PDIF
* Flexible DSP insert loops
* Integrated Sample Rate Converter
* One-button SRC activation
* SCMS control
* De-Emphasis control

“I wanted a central routing system that allowed every optical and coaxial digital input and output of my complete music system to be controlled according to my own requirements.”

The Digital Audio Patchbay has been an integral part of the author's setup since 1995.
To the author's knowledge, no comparable product combining these functions was commercially available at that time.

# Why is this repository unique?

This repository includes:

* Complete Intel 8051 Assembly firmware
* Original CPLD source code
* Original GAL source code
* Original hand-drawn engineering schematics
* Prototype photographs
* Original German user manual
* Engineering documentation
* Historical design information

Rather than recreating the original work with modern tools, the original engineering documents have intentionally been preserved.

# Original Engineering Documents

One of the most valuable parts of this repository is the collection of original hand-drawn engineering schematics.

Unlike modern CAD-generated schematics, the original circuit diagrams are preserved in their hand-drawn form.
These drawings document the actual engineering process and therefore remain part of the historical documentation.

They document the actual engineering process and therefore form an important part of the historical archive.

Included are:

* CPU Controller Board
* Audio Matrix
* Format Converter
* Digital Routing Logic

•	One central digital audio router for the complete music system.
•	Support for optical and coaxial S/PDIF.
•	Flexible routing of all digital inputs and outputs.
•	Independent monitoring and recording paths.
•	Integrated sample rate converter.
•	Sample rate converter selectable by a single key press.
•	Multiple external DSP insert loops.
•	Direct manipulation of selected S/PDIF channel status bits.
•	SCMS modification.
•	De-Emphasis modification.
•	High operational simplicity.
•	Reliable real-time operation.

# Hardware

The system consists of several dedicated hardware modules:

* CPU Controller Board
* Digital Audio Matrix
* Sample Rate Converter
* S/PDIF Receiver / Transmitter
* Analog Output Stage
* Front Panel Controller
* Power Supply

---

# Firmware

The complete firmware has been written entirely in **Intel 8051 Assembly Language**.

No C compiler has been used.

Every hardware function, timing requirement and peripheral interface was implemented manually without the use of a C compiler.

Today, complete embedded systems of this complexity written entirely in assembly language have become increasingly rare, making this repository an interesting historical reference for embedded software engineering.

---

# Programmable Logic

The repository also contains the complete programmable logic.

Included are:

* CPLD source code
* GAL source code

These devices implement essential parts of the digital routing architecture.

# Engineering Philosophy

This project was not developed as a commercial product.

It was developed to solve a practical engineering problem within a complete digital music environment.

The repository therefore documents not only the finished system but also the engineering decisions behind its development.

---

# Lessons Learned

The original TTL design worked perfectly.

Until it didn't.

Only long-term operation inside a warm studio rack revealed a problem that could never be reproduced on the laboratory bench.

Replacing dozens of TTL gates by a single CPLD solved the issue permanently.

Engineering is often driven by observation rather than theory.

# Historical Preservation

This repository intentionally preserves

* original firmware

* original schematics

* original documentation

* original photographs

rather than replacing them with modern equivalents.

The goal is to preserve the engineering history of the project.
